ProjectEnvironmentalGuardian is a web application. This project aims to raise awareness about the issue of solid waste generation, emphasizing the responsibility of humans in their relationship with nature. Through various initiatives and tools implemented in the application, we seek to inform and educate people about the importance of proper waste management, promoting sustainable practices that respect the environment. Our goal is to inspire a change in behavior and advocate for a more eco-friendly lifestyle, thereby contributing to the preservation of the natural environment for future generations..
